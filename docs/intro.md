# NFTez

### Build NFT Dapp. Faster, Easier.

This is our submission for the first edition of the [H-W3B hackathon](https://www.sia-partners.com/fr/publications/publications-de-nos-experts/h-w3b-2023) by Sia Partners. Our goal is to ease the development of Dapp on the Tezos NFT ecosystem by providing reliable data with a straightforward API.

Our first iteration is a SDK that abstract the use of [Teztok](https://www.teztok.com/), an indexer specialized in NFT data. We provide easy-to-use functions to request basic and advanced data. See the [function list](#functions-list) for more informations.
